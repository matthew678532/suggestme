## Outline

This is a brainstorm for an application which collects a users location data, and provides various activities local to the user.

The thought process is that several apis shall be interrogated, to gather data relating to:

- the cinema & the theatre
- local events & festivals
- food & drink places
- nightlife
- shopping centres
- national parks

## Possible APIs

## Architecture

Due to the size of the application, and the likely complexities that will be encountered during development, the application will be need to be separated into layers. One layer will handle the business logic of the application, and the other layer will handle user inputs and requests.

To accomodate for these layers, a RESTful api is to be developed to handle the business logic, and a web application is to be developed to handle user requests.

However, through implementing a RESTful api, the development of applications can be cross-platform (iOS, Android, etc). Therefore, future developments may include builds for these platforms.
